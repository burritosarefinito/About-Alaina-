      <p><strong>Bio:</strong> I am a 17 year old girl still trying to figure out what I want to do in life. I’m confused on what path I should take but, I know that I love to dance. Dancing makes me feel free, like I am able to express myself. I love to listen to all kinds of music even though some are hard to dance to in my opinion. I also have interest in becoming a dermatologist, chef, or a cosmetologist. I love to look at stars and being in nature. Nature is my number one choice if I could live on my own. I’ve been in many different areas of Jersey City. I even lived in Paterson but that was in my younger years.
